1) HelloWorldML.ipynb = Basic ML model which will guess the genre of songs for people based on their ages using Decision Tree algorithm. Ex: Most of the people like Hip-hop during the age 20-25 and classical music above 30. (Just an assumption)
2) Support Vector Machine.ipynb = ML model which will guess whether if it's a muffin or cupcake using SVM algorithm.
3) Linear Regression.ipynb = ML model which will find out the total profits of a company using Linear Regression algorithm.
4) Decision Tree.ipynb = Little detailed ML model which will predict whether a customer will repay loan or not using Decision Tree algorithm.
